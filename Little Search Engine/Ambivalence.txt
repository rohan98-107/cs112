Ambivalence


Ben Greenman



When a girl is skinny, and calls you late at night, and you glance at
the calendar, and it is four days before you are scheduled to get married,
and the girl you are marrying is not the skinny girl but another
girl, a girl who has already departed for the city where your wedding
is to be held, it is your job, most probably, to hang up the phone.
When you do not hang up the phone, you have not done your job.
When you invite that skinny girl to your apartment, and then you
jump into the shower so that you will be clean, taking special trouble
to wash the parts that matter, and then you mess up your hair so that
you will look as though you havenâ€™t gone to any special trouble, then
you are doing another job entirely.
