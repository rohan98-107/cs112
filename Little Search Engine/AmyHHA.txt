Amy Having a Heart Attack


Sharon Goldner



When Amy hears what her father has done, she thinks she is having
a heart attack.


“Are you sure?” she asks her mother, who is out of state in Amy’s
childhood home. Amy is talking loudly because of the din of the
lawnmower going at it next door.


Her mother screams “Goddamn it” and hangs up the phone on
Amy. That’s when Amy thinks she feels the heart attack give birth to
itself. Her whole left breast aches underneath where she suspects her
heart is. Amy tries calling her mother back but she will not answer
and the heart attack lightning-bolts her. It isn’t at all what she thinks
a heart attack will feel like.“Let it be over quickly,” she says. When 
there is no response, Amy answers herself: “Okay.”
